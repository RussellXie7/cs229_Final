# Data Processing and Visualisation

## Data storage

- Directory name must be unique and should be reasonably descriptive
- Each directory should contain 26 csv files only, with names being `{character}.csv`

## Preprocessing

Under construction.

Given a source directory, a destination directory:

- read all 26 files from the source
- concate all rows with respective label
- create `{source_dir_name}.csv` in `dest_dir` if not exist
- dump labeled data to the above file

## Visualizer

Under construction.
